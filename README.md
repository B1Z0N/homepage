# My personal homepage.

An extensible frontend-only site to show off my professional shape. It is aimed to be easy to insert new topics on-the-fly, not bothering backend and administration panel.

# Customization 

All customization is done through four topics:

- `skills`
- `projects`
- `contributions`
- `resume`

To customize any of these, say, "topic" is one of these four. You need to go to `custom/[topic].js` and read it's comments.

# Future

1. It may be useful to have some scripts to automate customization 
2. Or even some actual backend to do this(like tg bots etc.)
